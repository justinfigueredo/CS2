or lowercase so i googled it)

- Completed method to check if the user login has at least one of the symbols: !,@,#,$ (took about 5 minutes)

- Completed method to check if the user login has at least one digit (took about 15 mins because i had to google to find the Character.isDigit() method)

- Completed method to check for invalid characters (took about 5 minutes)
